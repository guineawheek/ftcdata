# Big Old TODO list

Backend:
* calculate surrogates (3rd match???)
* calculate dqed?
* consider more backend design changes (why do i haev to redesign so much)
* actually prerender pages instead of the increasingly large devserver.py file
* reorganize codebase
* pylint codebase
* make it so that random bits of logic aren't scattered literally everywhere
* event locations and websites
* fix the vagrant build to not suck as much
* event id generation (hard problem!!!!!)
* somehow cross-correlate events in db with first's team and event search (hard problem)
* find the real locations of those APO,AE teams

Frontend:
* events list page doesn't work
* team history doesn't work
* teams don't have events
* team links are still using year format instead of season format (oops!)

* default events page tries to show teams and results at once and it's bad
* qual points/match is overfull
* finals divisions don't have event divisions dropdowns
* elimination brackets don't have alliance numbers
* alliances aren't rendered
* match details page doesn't work
* match details links don't exist from events
* awards page literally doesn't exist yet

Down the road:
* create a media model 
* strip tba branding fully
* try to find an xss/csrf in toa to really stick it to them (and dm soren about it to report it responsibly)
* make sure you yourself don't have xss/csrf vulns
* actually make the UI a useful UI
* make better insights pages than top 15 oprs lol

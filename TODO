# Big Old TODO list

Backend:
FIXED calculate surrogates (3rd match???)
* calculate dqed?
* consider more backend design changes (why do i haev to redesign so much)
* actually prerender pages instead of the increasingly large devserver.py file
* reorganize codebase
* pylint codebase
* make it so that random bits of logic aren't scattered literally everywhere
* event locations and websites
* fix the vagrant build to not suck as much
* event id generation (hard problem!!!!!)
* somehow cross-correlate events in db with first's team and event search (hard problem)
* find the real locations of those APO,AE teams
* do league ranking calcuations and display them


* make a model that represents teams at events rather than rev-engineering it from the rankings table
* region of events
* bijection between region codenames and regions

Frontend:
FIXED events list page doesn't work
FIXED team history doesn't work
FIXED teams don't have events
FIXED team links are still using year format instead of season format (oops!)

FIXED default events page tries to show teams and results at once and it's bad
FIXED qual points/match is overfull
FIXED finals divisions don't have event divisions dropdowns
FIXED* (until 8 alliance business) * elimination brackets don't have alliance numbers
FIXED alliances aren't rendered
* match details page doesn't work
FIXED match details links don't exist from events
FIXED awards page literally doesn't exist yet

* make a front page LOL

Down the road:
* create a media model 
* strip tba branding fully
* try to find an xss/csrf in toa to really stick it to them (and dm soren about it to report it responsibly)
* make sure you yourself don't have xss/csrf vulns
* actually make the UI a useful UI
* make better insights pages than top 15 oprs lol
DONE old champs data
DONE ftcpenn data
* ftc-data data
* moftcscores data
* ftcscores data
* toa data
